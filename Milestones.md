## 2.0 - Start of The Open Data Platform
We want SecretAgent users to be able to start playing with Hero and understand the unique advancements of FlowHandlers, DOM Extensions, and understand where we are going.

## 2.1 - First Network Deployment
Someone should be able to stand up a single Miner on an AWS machine, push a Databox to that machine and query it. Nothing more. No UI.

## 2.2 - First Payment
Allow payment to be attached to a Databox and when queried it forces payment to be included. This includes the minimum ecosystem needed for acquiring Argons and using them. It should also cement the conceptual idea that Ulixee’s sidechain is built to run “on top of a blockchain”.

## 2.3 - First Network Cluster
The goal is to make network deployment actually usable at a scale beyond a single Miner. This is also what we will use to stand up the alpha version of Ulixee Cloud.

## 2.4 - Promoted to Manager
Add, remove and manage your Miners/clusters. Manage your databoxes, track errors and view your revenue. We also plan on adding an ability to plug in 3rd party services which will require support for approving and managing monthly subscriptions.

## 2.5 - Troubled Heroes
Add tooling into ChromeAlive to step through scripts, see results of every command, and deeply inspect all parts of a session. This step also involves troubleshooting when a user is blocked (aka, finding probed APIs, reporting issues, etc).

## 2.6 - ULIXEE-CLOUD
Add a button to ChromeAlive/Builder that allows packaging and deploying on the Cloud. We will run the Databox when queried and split the proceeds with the Databox/Domain.

## 2.7 - OWNERSHIP
Allow Databoxes to be wrapped as NFTs so their revenue stream can be bought and sold on 3rd party NFT marketplaces.

## 2.8 - DOMAINS-SCHEMAS

## 2.9 - RELIABILITY-TESTING

## 2.10 - MARKETPLACE-COMPOSER

## 2.11 - CODE-GENERATORS
Assistance writing State Generators and Selector Generators by allowing ChromeAlive interface to select attributes, and then testing cross-Session. Extraction gets tree-shaking to figure out selectors automatically.

# 3.X OPENING ULIXEE CLOUD
We are still running the Mainchain through our single Miner, and it’s still going no further than the Genesis Block, however, it is using ProofOfKnowledge to verify new blocks. Anyone can now plug in their compute resources into the Ulixee Cloud and participate in the jobs.

# 4.X KICKSTARTING THE MAINCHAIN
We are still running the Mainchain through our single Miner, but now ProofOfKnowdge hashes are being used to actually create and connect blocks. However, it is our single Miner that verifies them and chooses the block. Shares are awarded. Argon is on “some exchange” so that the price fluctuates. When the price dips Bonds can be bought. Also, people can move their Argons back and forth between the Sidechain and Mainchain. Etc etc.

# 5.X - DECENTRALIZED PARTICIPATION
We are no longer the only Miner that can verify and add blocks to the mainchain. However, we will probably keep some form of control/punishment to keep the network in line (i.e., Bounty Hunters or validators or some similar concept). Also, we are likely injecting the oracle data for CPI values, etc.

# 6.X - DECENTRALIZED GOVERNANCE
The Data Liberation Foundation is no longer required. Mojitos!!!!
