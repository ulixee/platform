# Ulixee

Ulixee is a scraping [engine][hero] with a built-in deployment [unit][datastore] that enables out-of-the-box [querying][stream] across a horizontal [deployment][cloud].

This repository is the development home to several of the tools that make it easy to build and manage these scripts, including [Ulixee Desktop](desktop), [Cloud][cloud] and [Datastore][datastore].

## Projects

- Hero `/hero`. The Automated Browser Engine built for scraping. (repository home - https://github.com/ulixee/hero).
- Datastore `/datastore`. Packaged "database" containing API access to crawler functions and extractor functions.
- Cloud `/cloud`. Run Ulixee tooling on a remote machine.
- Stream `/stream`. Query, transform and compose Datastores running on any machine.
- Desktop `/desktop`. Supercharge scraper script development using a Hero Replay toolset, remote Datastore viewer and Error troubleshooter.

## Tooling

Try out [Ulixee Desktop!](https://github.com/ulixee/desktop). It's a helpful tool for developing and managing your Ulixee scripts.

### Docker

We publish a Docker image of the latest Ulixee Cloud to:
- Github Container Registry: `docker pull ghcr.io/ulixee/ulixee-cloud && docker tag ghcr.io/ulixee/ulixee-cloud ulixee/ulixe-cloud`
- DockerHub: `docker pull ulixee/ulixee-cloud`

To use the image, we have a [run.sh](./cloud/tools/docker/run.sh) script that will run with a non-root user on your choice of port. All environmental configurations are listed [here](./cloud/main/.env.defaults).

## Developer Environment

This project serves as a Monorepo for developing the Ulixee Datastore and Cloud. If you are developing, you might wish to have [hero][hero] as a project adjacent to this one.

1Run `yarn build:all` from the this repository to build all the projects.
